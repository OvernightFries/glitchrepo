        <h1 class="name"> Kai Lam Kingsley U </h1>
        <p> Hello! My name is Kingsley and I'm currently a rising Junior in the SF Bay Area! I attend school at a Public Magnet High School named Lowell High. Some fun facts about me include my love for basketball and eating. I'm a foodie, and I enjoy many kinds of food and will always be open to trying new ones. </p>


        <h2>A little more about me </h2>
        <p> Some words that describe me include humorous, hardworking, and friendly! I was first interested in the area of computer science when I became exposed to it through a robotics team that I'm in at school. I was stunned by how little I knew, and how much code can do. As a result of that, I began taking on more computer science opportunities such as this one. Outside of computer science, some video games </p>

        <br>

        <h2> Why Code Nation? </h2>

        <p> I chose Code Nation because I wanted to give myself an opportunity to learn how to code in CSS, Javascript, and HTML, as well as meet like minded individuals who also want to learn how to code. I believe Code Nation can give me the stepping stones that I need to take a step forward and begin my journey as a developer. </p>
